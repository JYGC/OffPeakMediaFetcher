This is why I have made this step by step guide on how to go about getting an official autism diagnosis either for yourself or someone you are helping \n\nSTEPS\n\n1 Create a list of all quirks and interesting differences that the person in question does out of ordinary.\n\n2 Take an online AQ test and record the score / print out the results.\n\n3 Call your doctor and ask for an appointment to discuss a referral for autism.\n\n4 Ask your doctor if you can have a referral for an autism assessment based off your list and results.\n \n5 Expect 2-3 assessments in the autism assessment process\n\n6 Observe your results and apply the recommend help and therapy\n\nSome cases, in some countries autism assessments can take up to 2 years to book, you can always opt for a private assessment but it probably will cost.\n\nLINKS:\nHopebridge Autism Therapy Centers - How is Autism Diagnosed?: https://youtu.be/8OW32QczJsw\n\nOsmosis - Autism - causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, pathology: https://youtu.be/x2hWVgZ8J4A\n\nScreening and Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder | CDC - https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/screening.html\n\nGetting diagnosed with autism - NHS - https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/autism/getting-diagnosed/",

Even the fed is actually a bank, but unlike any other bank, it creates money. \nBut what if I told you that every bank has the right to create money?\nTheoretically, you can start a bank and start creating money, but there is an easier way. Why waste so much money first starting a bank when you can start a cryptocurrency and become a crypto-billionaire overnight.??\n\nAt least that's what has been happening lately. If cryptocurrencies seem to you like a scam, then you probably don't know much about the banks. So, here in this video, we are going to take a look at 5 truths about money that banks don't want you to know because if everyone would know that, that might be the end of the banking system. Or as Henry ford said: It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our??banking??and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.",

In this video you'll learn about how an increasingly connected and complex world led to some pretty deep rifts in countries across the continent. We'll learn about financial crises that rippled across the world. We'll learn about wars and resultant migrations that sowed discord in many European nations. Increasing polarization and populism played out in movements like Brexit in the UK. While we don't know what the future holds, an understanding of the roots of conflict can help create a roadmap for the future.\n\nWatch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! \nDownload here for Apple Devices: https://apple.co/3d4eyZo\nDownload here for Android Devices: https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!
