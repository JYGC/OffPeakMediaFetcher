Prior to this I taught for about a decade in various high school and undergraduate settings, specializing in organic chemistry but also teaching general chemistry, physics, and biology.\n\nThis channel is certainly for students in science courses at both the high school and undergraduate level, but it is also for members of the general public that just want to know a little more about the world and how things work.

I work three days a week as a teacher in elementary school and I'm a freelance graphic designer on the side. I live with my husband in a cozy town in The Netherlands.\n\n//\n\nFrequently asked questions:\n• Are you self-taught on the violin or do you have a teacher?\nI have been taking private lessons from the start.\n• What brand violin do you have?\nAt first I rented a violin at the luthier. After a year, I could rent a better violin from the music school where I have my lessons. In February 2020, after almost 4 years of playing the violin, I bought my very own violin, built by Roderich Paesold in 2017.\n\n//\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA & CONTACT:\n\nE-MAIL:\nmarijke.plays@gmail.com\n\nINSTAGRAM:\n@marijke.violin",

Being able to read music is a great help now of course. So, I didn’t have to start from zero when first took up the violin.\n\nI will be sharing videos about my violin progress, including pieces from Suzuki books, etudes from Wohlfahrt, Pracht, Sitt and others, popular fiddle tunes, and much more.\n\nTo follow my violin progress or have a chat with other adult violinists, please visit my website http://www.violinadventures.com",

Thanks for coming to my channel. \n\nMy background is specifically in stellar and planetary formations, including low-mass stars, Proto-planetary disks and exo-planetary systems. However I did spend a lot of time studying deep cosmology, galaxy evolutions and active galactic nuclei and supermassive black holes. \n\nMy biggest goal with this channel is to make all the complicated astrophysics topics digestable for the average human with minimal science knowledge. \n\nLately I've been more into rocket science and the evolution of getting humans further out into space and eventually setting up a lunar base and colonizing Mars. \n\nSo, whether you are a PhD professor or haven't taken science since high school, I welcome you all to the Astroathens Channel. \n\nxoxo",

In the beginning, I had lessons every two weeks for about three months, then once a month, till mid 2011. I was lucky that I met my first teacher Feifei, who not only taught me skills but also gave me tremendous encouragement. Then life got busy and had some changes, I didn't take any lesson till July 2013, when I found my second teacher, who I only had a few lessons with. In the last week of January 2015, I found my third teacher Craig Bate who I took lessons from for a year and a half, before moving across the country. \n\nFollow me on Instagram and Facebook: violineest",

Because of this, people tend to lose interest and sometimes even start to hate it. \n\nIn each video that I make, I try to balance theory with purpose. My goal is to show the natural beauty of chemistry in fun and interesting ways. Chemistry is happening all around us all the time, and there are a lot of really awesome chemicals and reactions out there! \n\nIn terms of education, I have a BSc in Biochemistry, with a minor in pharmacology. However, I've always been a lot more drawn to applied chemistry. So after finishing my degree, I worked as a lab tech in an organic lab and then as a chemistry grad student. However, I ended up leaving my graduate studies early to focus on this channel. Now, making chemistry videos has become my full-time job.\n\nIf you would like to support me, you can check out my Patreon here: https://www.patreon.com/nilered\n\nFor business related inquiries contact me at admin@nilered.ca",

What began as an occasional hobby turned into a passion as I realized that there is always something new to learn, or when given the opportunity to teach and/or help others each and every day.\n \nOriginally, I was focused on video games and movies and took them at face value which is what we should be able to do at times; sit back, relax, enjoy and turn off the thought process, (if we are ever truly able to do so). Eventually my interest and research in psychology, philosophy and their effect on the world and, in this case, specifically the area of entertainment, led me to further research. \n \nMore recently, I have been drawn to the important topics of mental health and autism. Never has there been a more important time for us to be informed, raise awareness and support one another throughout the various challenges we are faced with in life.",

Prior to this I taught for about a decade in various high school and undergraduate settings, specializing in organic chemistry but also teaching general chemistry, physics, and biology.\n\nThis channel is certainly for students in science courses at both the high school and undergraduate level, but it is also for members of the general public that just want to know a little more about the world and how things work.

It's a challenging but amazing journey! On this channel I share my progress, performances, musical adventures and advice.\n\nMy name is Marijke. I work three days a week as a teacher in elementary school and I'm a freelance graphic designer on the side. I live with my husband in a cozy town in The Netherlands.\n\n//\n\nFrequently asked questions:\n• Are you self-taught on the violin or do you have a teacher?\nI have been taking private lessons from the start.\n• What brand violin do you have?\nAt first I rented a violin at the luthier. After a year, I could rent a better violin from the music school where I have my lessons. In February 2020, after almost 4 years of playing the violin, I bought my very own violin, built by Roderich Paesold in 2017.\n\n//\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA & CONTACT:\n\nE-MAIL:\nmarijke.plays@gmail.com\n\nINSTAGRAM:\n@marijke.violin",

I am soooo excited that I finally am playing the violin and I’d love to share what I learned with others who are learning to play the violin too.\n\nAs a child and teenager I have been playing the clarinet and learned to read music. Being able to read music is a great help now of course. So, I didn’t have to start from zero when first took up the violin.\n\nI will be sharing videos about my violin progress, including pieces from Suzuki books, etudes from Wohlfahrt, Pracht, Sitt and others, popular fiddle tunes, and much more.\n\nTo follow my violin progress or have a chat with other adult violinists, please visit my website http://www.violinadventures.com",

I liked it but never really felt the connection between me and the instrument. \n\nFelt in love with violin in Aug 2010 and immediately decided to learn. In the beginning, I had lessons every two weeks for about three months, then once a month, till mid 2011. I was lucky that I met my first teacher Feifei, who not only taught me skills but also gave me tremendous encouragement. Then life got busy and had some changes, I didn't take any lesson till July 2013, when I found my second teacher, who I only had a few lessons with. In the last week of January 2015, I found my third teacher Craig Bate who I took lessons from for a year and a half, before moving across the country. \n\nFollow me on Instagram and Facebook: violineest",

Because of this, people tend to lose interest and sometimes even start to hate it. \n\nIn each video that I make, I try to balance theory with purpose. My goal is to show the natural beauty of chemistry in fun and interesting ways. Chemistry is happening all around us all the time, and there are a lot of really awesome chemicals and reactions out there! \n\nIn terms of education, I have a BSc in Biochemistry, with a minor in pharmacology. However, I've always been a lot more drawn to applied chemistry. So after finishing my degree, I worked as a lab tech in an organic lab and then as a chemistry grad student. However, I ended up leaving my graduate studies early to focus on this channel. Now, making chemistry videos has become my full-time job.\n\nIf you would like to support me, you can check out my Patreon here: https://www.patreon.com/nilered\n\nFor business related inquiries contact me at admin@nilered.ca",

Because of this, people tend to lose interest and sometimes even start to hate it. \n\nIn each video that I make, I try to balance theory with purpose. My goal is to show the natural beauty of chemistry in fun and interesting ways. Chemistry is happening all around us all the time, and there are a lot of really awesome chemicals and reactions out there! \n\nIn terms of education, I have a BSc in Biochemistry, with a minor in pharmacology. However, I've always been a lot more drawn to applied chemistry. So after finishing my degree, I worked as a lab tech in an organic lab and then as a chemistry grad student. However, I ended up leaving my graduate studies early to focus on this channel. Now, making chemistry videos has become my full-time job.\n\nIf you would like to support me, you can check out my Patreon here: https://www.patreon.com/nilered\n\nFor business related inquiries contact me at admin@nilered.ca",

What began as an occasional hobby turned into a passion as I realized that there is always something new to learn, or when given the opportunity to teach and/or help others each and every day.\n \nOriginally, I was focused on video games and movies and took them at face value which is what we should be able to do at times; sit back, relax, enjoy and turn off the thought process, (if we are ever truly able to do so). Eventually my interest and research in psychology, philosophy and their effect on the world and, in this case, specifically the area of entertainment, led me to further research. \n \nMore recently, I have been drawn to the important topics of mental health and autism.

I don't know if a god exists, but I do KNOW the Abrahamic God doesn't exist, for He is an illogical concept, rife with contradiction - a square circle of loving wrath, known to have gone through an evolution as He was compiled by the ancients throughout history.\n\nThis channel has always been mainly about criticism of religious ideas. I neither support nor condone the oppression of anybody because of their religion. People should be able to freely practice their religion as long as doing so does not entail infringing upon the rights of others.\n\n I am also known as DarkAntics.",
